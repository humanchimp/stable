# :horse: stable

an experimental test framework built with async generators.

inspired by jasmine. bring your own assertion library.

## api

You can use it as a library:
```javascript
import { describe, run } from 'stable'

run([
  describe("a feature")
    .it("works!", () => { console.log("Golly!"); })
    .it("is bug-free", () => {
      assert(true)
    })
])

```
Build up suites using the fluent API. Maximal simplicity and flexibility at the cost of some boilerplate (extra leading dots; you have to call `run` yourself)

I will most likely implement a framework on top of the library. It would then allow you to write code that is virtually identical to jasmine or mocha or jest.
```javascript

describe("a feature", () => {
  it("works like a bdd framework!", () => {
    console.log("This is sort of like jasmine or mocha");
  })

  it("is time-tested", () => {
    assert(true)
  })
})
```
This part is not implemented yet. But it's planned. This is most likely how I will use this most of the time.

## why another test framework?

Because this one is mine.

The real reason is that I wanted to play with async generators and this seemed like a good use case for them. But I like the result so far, and I want to build out my own framework as an experiment. I got really excited about jest, but then it turned out to be way too opinionated and wasn't going to work well for my use cases. So I welcome the opportunity to have my own lattice to hang implements onâ€”the ones that make my own peculiar tradeoffs.

So that is why.

## north star

It should be dead simple and self-contained. It should be flexible and, failing that, hackable.

## goals

- [x] Suites (`describe`)
- [x] Specs (`it`)
- [x] Hooks (`{before,after}{Each,All}`)
- [x] Metadata (`meta` and `url` annotations)
- [ ] `describeEach` a nice innovation from jest
- [ ] Reporters (tap built in, others possible)
- [ ] Plays nice.
  - [ ] Works with karma
  - [ ] Works with testem
  - [ ] Works with jsdom
- [ ] Suite partitioning
- [ ] Suite randomization
- [ ] Familiar BDD interface
